## Tips
### Pre-filling
Most information is pre-filled at the stage of invoice registering and should be verified by invoice owners. Only specific information require filling in by invoice owners. 

### Return instead of clicking 
If clicking on a button or a tab doesnâ€™t move you to another position, hit **Return** on your keyboard instead. 

### Editable fields
You can only edit fields that are in white. Colored or shaded fields cannot be edited by invoice owners. 

### Forwarding invoice
If you need to forward an invoice to another user or team, in **Acceptance path** select the code of the team or person to whom you want to send it and clik **Accept**.
