# Live Kid

Live Kid is an application designed for parents and kindergarten teachers. It enables communication and exchange of information regarding kid’s activities during the day. It is divided into several sections where you can read, edit or send information and watch photos or videos. 

**NOTE**
 If two or more of your kids attend our kindergarten, you can select between their profiles by clicking on the child’s initials or photo in the upper right corner of the screen. You can see the profile of one child at a time.
 
Initials are presented by default. You can add a photo in **Account Settings**.
