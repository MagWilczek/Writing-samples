## Hello

Thank you for taking time to review my technical writing samples.

I hold a Master's degree in English and have several years of experience in drafting, translating and proofreading various kinds of documents, from mandatory disclosures of a listed company througho presentations to press releases. Throughout my career I have always been working with words and it has always given me pleasure.

As I have little professional experience as a technical writer I decided to build my sample portfolio by writing documentation for applications that I use every day for private or business purposes. I am a self-learner and am aware of my potential limitations. However, I really enjoy collecting information, searching for details and clicking through projects, and then gathering it all under one product.

On my own, I have taken several technical writing courses, including Google Technical Writing One and Two, Google Writing Helpful Error Messages, GitLab Technical Writing Fundamentals, and Google Understand the Basics of Code. I am familiar with the scope covered by the ITCQF International Technical Communication Qualifications Foundation syllabus. Currently, I am reading the ISTQB Certified Tester Foundation Level syllabus to gain basic knowledge about testing.

I have also been learning how to use several authoring tools such as MadCap Flare, Adobe RoboHelp, Adobe FrameMaker, or Atlassian Confluence. 

If you have any questions I would be happy to answer them in person or during an online meeting.
