## Troubleshooting
### Invoice date in previous month
If the date of the invoice lies in previous month you may be unable to access it. In such case in **Settlement period** change the accounting date to current date.

### Not your invoice
If you see an invoice on your list that belongs to another owner select **Preliminary registration** from the list next to **Reject** button. The **Reject** button will activate once you select the item on the list. Click it to send the invoice back to the person who assigns invoices to owners. 

### Tax date conflict
If the invoice is approved after the end of the month to which it refers you might need to change **Tax declaration date** in **Tax** tab to current date.
